        "option4": "Hola　ホラー",
        "answer": 3, 
        "explanation": "Kon'nichi'wa is hello in Japanese! However this is usually said in the afternoons! The Chinese characters (漢字 Kanji), for kon'nichi'wa (今日は) mean 'how was today' which is why it is usually used in the afternoons. Oha'iyou gozaimasu おはようございます is good morning and konban wa こんばんは is good evening!"

        "explanation": "Trains changing course at certain stops can happen but the announcements are usually only in Japanese. If this happens get off immediately because you may end up (worst case senario) in a whole different prefecture. It's best to ask the train concuctors if you know the name of the place you want to go, they'll help you get there! A great phrase for this situation is sumimasen, [name of place] ikitai desu 'Excuse me, I'd like to go to [name of place]. すみません、渋谷へ行きたいです！"

        "option1": "True ",
        "option2": "False",
        "answer": 2,
        "explanation": "Eating and drinking in Japan whilst walking is not illegal but heavily frowned upon. Unless you're an office worker and you're running for the train whilst eating a rice ball. Tourist towns or areas that specialise in food usually have a thing called 食べ歩き (tabe aruki) which literally means 'eat and walk'. But if walking and eating isn't allowed how do they do this? Well each restaurant/shop/stall, has a small area where you eat what you've bought before moving on. The portons are usually small portions or are just snacks that are special to the area, not full meals! Convenience stores also usually have small areas for patrons to eat their food before they leave!"

        "option2": "False",
        "answer": 2, 
        "explanation": "Talking on the phone is most definitely not allowed on public transport and you will most likely be told to stop. Japanese culture puts emphasis on being considerate to others and unnecessary noise is frowned upon, people are even asked to turn their phones on vibrate when on public transport! You can talk to those around you but not too loudly."

        "option2": "False",
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "There is so much delicious food in Japan to try it's almost incomprehensible. No matter where you go there will be something new to try so always research before you head out! お土産 omiyage is a gift you buy from places you visit to give to other people. These are usually specialty sweets or keychains (most regions have their own mascot too!) and since this a big part of Japanese culture you will find omiyage anywhere in Japan. People even buy some to give to their co-workers!"

        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "If you are lost you should always look for a building with the sign 交番 (kouban) which will be the neighbourhood police office. They are usually small and deal with this all the time. They are also more likely to speak English! Police officers usually wear a navy blue uniform that says 'police' in English!"
