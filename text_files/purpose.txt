About this APP: 

This application is an interactive travel guide that will allow users to be able to learn more about Japanese food and famous attractions as well as provide useful phrases and cultural insights. 
The purpose of this application is to provide people a chance to learn more about a country they may not have had the chance to visit, especially due to the pandemic. 
Public health emergencies have the ability to affect the health and well-being of communities and individuals (Pfefferbaum & North 2020).  
Long durations of confinement, inability to see friends and loved ones, and fear of the unknown trigger emotional stresses such as frustration, boredom, stress and in some cases depression (Pfefferbaum & North 2020). 
Anticipation of positive events has been shown to have a positive correlation to individual well-being (Luo et al., 2018). 
The anticipation process of future desired events was also shown to encourage positive relations with others (Edmondson & MacLeod, 2013) . 
This app will provide information on real places and fun facts with the purpose of giving the user something to look forward to once travel is accessible again. 
The app will direct the user to choose what topic they are interested in, engage them in mini quizzes that relate to important phrases in Japanese and possible travel situations. 
The quizzes allow the user to imagine themselves in a situation and how they would respond. It gives the user a chance to engage in positive anticipation and aims to instill excitement of the future. 
The answers to the quizzes would provide cultural insights and how best to respond to certain travel situations.
